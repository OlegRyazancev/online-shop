      Welcome to the Notification Service API! This API provides endpoints for getting notifications,

      This service operates independently and does not directly connect to the base API gateway.
      Communication with other services is handled via Feign clients or kafka message broker, also 
      configured websockets to send messages to clients.
      
      User authentication is required to access these endpoints. Please ensure you have appropriate
      authentication credentials before making requests.

      _**Note:** It is a **technical service**, but you can make some example requests._

      Explore the comprehensive documentation to understand the functionality and usage of each endpoint.
